# HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION

# Hand Gesture Detection

Welcome to the Hand Gesture Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources for detecting hand gestures using computer vision techniques.

## Overview

Hand Gesture Detection is a project aimed at recognizing and interpreting human hand gestures using machine learning and computer vision. This technology can be used in a variety of applications, including:
- Human-computer interaction
- Sign language interpretation
- Virtual reality and augmented reality
- Robotics

- ## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Accurate recognition of various hand gestures
- Easy to integrate with other applications
- Extensible for new gestures and functionalities

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Princekumar7999/hand_gesture_detection.git
   cd hand_gesture_detection

2.Install the required dependencies:
Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Set up your environment:
Ensure you have the necessary libraries for computer vision (e.g., OpenCV) and machine learning frameworks.

USAGE 
1.Run the hand gesture detection script:

python detect_gestures.py
(you can change name to on your system)

2.Customize the gestures:
Modify the gestures folder to add or adjust the gestures you want to detect. Update the script accordingly to handle new gestures.

3.Integration:
Integrate the hand gesture detection module with your application by importing the necessary functions and classes.
